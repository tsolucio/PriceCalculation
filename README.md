Discount on Product and Service Category module
=======

This business settings module will permit you to define discounts per product/service line and/or clients.

The goal of this change is to permit direct discounts for each account based on the category of products and/or services. It will permit us, for example, to assign a 10% discount to any account when he buys products in the software category and an 8% discount if he uses services in the technical category. These discounts will be automatically applied when selecting the product/service on the quote, sales order, or invoice.

The module synchronizes the category picklists on the service and product entities, so, once the change has been applied both picklists will be the same on both modules and can be easily maintained in the picklist editor of either module.

The new Discount Line module also shares this picklist with the two modules. It permits us to select the associated account and indicate the amount of discount to apply to any category. The relation of discounts can be seen on the account's more information tab and there is a security check so you can't apply two or more discounts to the same category for the same account.

You can read more about the module in the [coreBOS Price Modification blog post](https://blog.corebos.org/blog/pricecalculation).

As usual with our work, we can adapt it to your needs. If you don't want the picklists synchronized, you want to relate to contacts, or need any other additional functionality, contact us.
